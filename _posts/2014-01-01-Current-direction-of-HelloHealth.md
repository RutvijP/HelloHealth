## Basic Formatting


## Paragraphs




## Headings

Sometimes it is useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading size. The following demonstrate the full range of heading sizes:

# Heading One (h1)

## Heading Two (h2)

### Heading Three (h3)

#### Heading Four (h4)

##### Heading Five (h5)

###### Heading Six (h6)

## Links

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in square brackets `[ ]`, and then wrapping the URL in parentheses `( )`. For example, it is very easy to [link to Google!](http://google.com).

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are useful for denoting quotes, or highlighting a large block of text. Single line blockquote:

> This quote will change your life.

Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:

> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.


## Unordered and Numbered Lists

You can make an unordered and nested list by preceding one or more lines of text with `-`, `*`, or `+`, and indenting sublists. The following lists show the full range of possible list formats.

* List item one
    * List item one
        * List item one
        * List item two
        * List item three
        * List item four
    * List item two
    * List item three
    * List item four
* List item two
* List item three
* List item four

Numbered lists are made by using numbers instead of bullet points.

1. List item one
    1. List item one
        1. List item one
        2. List item two
        3. List item three
        4. List item four
    2. List item two
    3. List item three
    4. List item four
2. List item two
3. List item three
4. List item four
